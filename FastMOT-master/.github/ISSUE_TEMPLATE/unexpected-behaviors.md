## Your Environment
<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->
<!--- I cannot help you with installation method not specified in README --->
* Desktop
  * Operating System and version:
  * NVIDIA Driver version:
  * Used the docker image?
* NVIDIA Jetson
  *  Which Jetson?
  * Jetpack version:
  * Ran install_jetson.sh?
  * Reinstalled OpenCV from Jetpack?

## Common issues
1. GStreamer warnings are normal
2. If you have issues with GStreamer on Desktop, disable GStreamer and build FFMPEG instead in Dockerfile
2. TensorRT plugin and engine files have to be built on the target platform and cannot be copied from a different architecture
3. Reinstalled OpenCV is usually not as optimized as the one shipped in Jetpack
